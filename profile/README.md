## 🔍 What Is Wallhack in RDR2?

Wallhack is a real-time **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)** overlay that marks enemies, animals, loot, and interactables even if they’re behind cover, inside buildings, or hiding in bushes. Whether you’re in **story mode** or **private online**, it turns Red Dead into an open book.

It’s like having eagle vision — without using Dead Eye.
